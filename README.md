# CommunityTales

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

This is a CMS for user-based stories. Users have the ability to write the first page(s) of a story. They are then posted publicly and users are free to read and extend these stories.

This platform's front-end is written in typescript using Angular 4. The back-end is entirely driven by Firebase.
